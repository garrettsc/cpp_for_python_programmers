# Note that with Python, there is no need to import a library
# in order to print to the console. 

#Printing a literal - Automatically attaches a newline character
print("Hello World")

#Print a literal - Replace the default newline character with a space
print("Hello World, again.", end=" ")

#Printing with formatting
some_string = "cruel"
print("Hello {} world".format(some_string))
